title: ERC-6909
---

Uniswap v4 uses [ERC-6909](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909) to further improve gas-efficiency on token claims and redemptions.

ERC-6909 is a simple multi-token contract standard. The token standard is analogous to managing multiple ERC-20 tokens from a single smart contract - similar to ERC-1155. The major difference between ERC-6909 vs. ERC-1155 is granular approvals and the removal of inefficient safe transfer callbacks.

# How it works

Instead of choosing to move tokens in/out of the `PoolManager`, developers can opt-in and leave the ERC-20 tokens within the `PoolManager`. In exchange, the `PoolManager` can **mint them an ERC-6909 token representing their claim**. In subsequent interactions requiring _paying_ tokens, users will not need to transfer ERC-20 tokens into the `PoolManager` - users can simply _burn_ some (or all) of their claim tokens they have


**Doing "real" ERC-20 token transfers would require calling functions on external smart contracts**. This presents the first gas overhead - external function calls. Secondly, these external smart contracts can have their own **custom logic within their transfer functions** - for example USDC has a blacklist it needs to check against before letting a transfer happen - which is a further gas overhead. Minting and burning ERC-6909 tokens therefore ends up being cheaper because it doesn't require external function calls and also has a **constant size gas overhead regardless of which underlying token is being represented by the claim token**.

This mechanism therefore helps further reduce gas costs. All these gas cost reductions overall make pools much more competitive based on the fees they charge.

# Examples

## High-frequency traders / MEV bots

These users are often conducting a lot of swaps in relatively short durations of time. ERC-6909 will benefit them from executing their trading strategy in a much more gas-efficient way.


## Daily users

Normal users could also benefit from such mechanism for example if they want to DCA on UNI for a month, they can let the `PoolManager` keep the actual UNI during the DCA and just use the ERC-6909 token to claim back all their UNI a month later to save a considerable amount of gas.
